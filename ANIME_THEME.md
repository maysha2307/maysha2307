# 🌸 Welcome to Our Anime Universe 🌸

## Happy Valentine's Day! 💜✨

I've transformed our website into an **anime-themed world** - a place where our love story unfolds like an epic anime adventure, just like the shows you love so much!

## 🗡️ What's New?

### Opening Animation - Sword Slash ⚔️
When you visit the site, you'll be greeted with a dramatic **sword-slicing animation** that splits the screen in two, revealing our anime world. Purple cursed energy particles burst across the screen (inspired by Jujutsu Kaisen's cursed energy effects)!

### Anime Color Theme 🎨
- **Deep Purple** (#8b5cf6) - The main cursed energy color
- **Electric Cyan** (#22d3ee) - Like Gojo's Six Eyes
- **Gold Accents** - Special moments and highlights
- **Dark Cosmic Background** - A mystical anime atmosphere

### Cursed Energy Effects 💫
- Floating **energy orbs** instead of hearts
- Glowing **cursed particles** that twinkle
- **Anime-style cards** with glowing borders
- Epic **energy button** instead of the regular button

### Anime-Inspired Messages 📖
I've updated all our romantic messages to include anime themes:
- "Step Into Our Anime Universe"
- "Where Every Moment is Epic"
- References to "episodes," "arcs," "leveling up," and "power-ups"
- Our promise is now framed as an eternal anime bond

## 🎌 The Jujutsu Kaisen Inspiration

This theme is heavily inspired by **Jujutsu Kaisen** (JJK):
- The purple cursed energy effects
- The dramatic sword slash opening
- The dark, mystical atmosphere
- The energy particles and orbs

## 💖 Why Anime?
